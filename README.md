# Certificate transparency for Android and JVM

:warning: While I strive to continue supporting this open-source project, I
don’t always have the time or resources to do so consistently. As a result,
issue resolution may take time.

At the time of writing, the most significant issues are:

1. **Dependency on Chrome’s Log List Files** As previously highlighted by
   engineers at Google, this library currently
   relies directly on Chrome’s log list files. While this primarily works, it
   carries inherent risks due to potential schema changes. Please refer to
   [#70](https://github.com/appmattus/certificatetransparency/issues/70)
   and [#143](https://github.com/appmattus/certificatetransparency/issues/143)
   for additional background information.

   I lack the time and resources to host and manage this file independently;
   therefore, it’s up to the users of the library to determine the best way to
   host and manage the file themselves.

1. **Android 16 (API 36) Support** Support for Android 16 is still in progress.
   I do not have access to a
   physical device running API 36, and the emulator has proven unreliable. As
   such, I’m relying on the community to help find a working solution (see
   [#142](https://github.com/appmattus/certificatetransparency/issues/142)).

   Given that API 36 finally introduces native support for Certificate
   Transparency (after a seven-year wait), the most practical approach might be
   to turn off this library on API 36 and utilise the built-in support instead.

1. **Caching Mechanism Issues** There are known problems with the library’s
   caching mechanism (see
   [#98](https://github.com/appmattus/certificatetransparency/issues/98)). I
   want to develop a more robust solution but haven’t yet had the focused time
   required to do so.

To protect our apps from man-in-the-middle attacks one of the first things that
usually springs to mind is certificate pinning. However, the issues of
certificate pinning are numerous. Firstly deciding on a reliable set of keys to
pin against is tough. Once you made that decision if your expectations don't
match reality your users suffer from not being able to access your app or
website. Smashing Magazine learnt about this the hard way in late 2016 when they
blocked users access for up to a year because of a mismatch between the pins and
the certificates. On mobile fixing an invalid pin means pushing out a new
version of an app which can still take a while to reach every user.

So with certificate pinning falling out of favour, what should you do? The new
kid in town is **[certificate transparency](docs/what-is-certificate-transparency.md)**.

## Security

We are open about the security of our library and provide a threat model in the
[source code](ThreatDragonModels/), created using
[OWASP Threat Dragon](https://owasp.org/www-project-threat-dragon/). If you feel there is something
we have missed please reach out so we can keep this up to date.

The source code and dependencies are continuously scanned with
[Snyk](https://snyk.io), [CodeQL](https://codeql.github.com) and [mobsfscan](https://github.com/MobSF/mobsfscan).

## Getting started

[![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/com.appmattus.certificatetransparency/certificatetransparency)](https://central.sonatype.com/search?q=com.appmattus.certificatetransparency)

For Android modules include the `android` dependency in your build.gradle file
which ensures the necessary ProGuard rules are present:

```kotlin
implementation("com.appmattus.certificatetransparency:certificatetransparency-android:<latest-version>")
```

> :warning: The library uses Java 8+ language features and requires [Desugaring](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/java8-support#library-desugaring)
> to be enabled to run on Android 7 (API 25) or less.

For Java library modules include the dependency as follows:

```kotlin
implementation("com.appmattus.certificatetransparency:certificatetransparency:<latest-version>")
```

On Android it is recommended to configure certificate transparency through the
provided [Java Security Provider](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/security/Provider.html)
at app startup, which can be configured through
`installCertificateTransparencyProvider`. The advantage of this setup is it
should work across all network types including WebViews with no additional
setup.

> :warning: Android's WebViews only allow you to override GET network requests
> through overriding the *shouldInterceptRequest* method. This means the only
> reliable way to implement certificate transparency in WebViews is to use the
> Java Security Provider documented here. However, if you are using WebViews on
> Android 6.0 (API 23) or lower then `installCertificateTransparencyProvider`
> will cause [issues](https://github.com/appmattus/certificatetransparency/issues/51)
> and should be avoided.

```kotlin
class SampleApplication : Application() {
    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()

        installCertificateTransparencyProvider {
            // Setup a logger
            // NOTE: The logger outputs the host name and certificate
            // transparency results which could be considered sensitive data.
            // Please ensure you review your usage.
            logger = BasicAndroidCTLogger(BuildConfig.DEBUG)

            // Setup disk cache
            diskCache = AndroidDiskCache(applicationContext)

            // Exclude any subdomain but not "appmattus.com" with no subdomain
            -"*.appmattus.com"

            // Exclude specified domain
            -"example.com"

            // Override the exclusion by including a specific subdomain
            +"allowed.appmattus.com"
        }
    }
}
```

Take a look at the [advanced configuration](docs/advanced-configuration.md) for
documentation on all the available options and [Using Certificate Transparency in SDKs](docs/using-certificate-transparency-in-sdks.md)
for guidance on usage in SDKs especially when using the Java Security Provider.

> :warning: Using the Java Security Provider may not work on all JVMs so if you
> are not on Android you are recommended to use one of the alternatives
> documented below.

Certificate transparency can also be setup in specific network connections,
instructions are available for:

- [OkHttp](docs/okhttp.md)
- [Retrofit](docs/retrofit.md)
- [HttpURLConnection](docs/httpurlconnection.md)
- [Volley](docs/volley.md)
- [X509TrustManager](docs/x509trustmanager.md) If you are dealing with non-HTTPS
  connections you can also use the library to verify the certificates by
  wrapping a X509TrustManager and using that.

Currently, there is no support in the library for [Apache HttpClient](https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-5.1.x/).

## Certificate revocation

Unfortunately in Android there is no built-in support for certificate
revocation, which means you're basically on your own. This is an incredibly hard
to solve problem and it is worth reading [revocation is broken](https://scotthelme.co.uk/revocation-is-broken/)
for more background. Needless to say I would argue that revocation is flawed
along with the broken implementations in mobile and web browsers.

For our purposes we've added `certificateRevocationInterceptor` to this library:

```kotlin
certificateRevocationInterceptor {
    addCrl(
        issuerDistinguishedName = "ME0xCzAJBgNVBAYTAlVTMRUwEwYDVQQKEwxEaWdpQ2VydCBJbmMxJzAlBgNVBAMTHkRpZ2lDZXJ0IFNIQTIgU2VjdXJlIFNlcnZlciBDQQ==",
        serialNumbers = listOf("Aa8e+91erglSMgsk/mtVaA==", "A3G1iob2zpw+y3v0L5II/A==")
    )
}
```

It is worth highlighting that the list of revoked certificates would need to be
built into the app and so would require pushing out an app update should you
want to add a revocation in. This does mean there's a small window for any
attacks using a revoked certificate.
